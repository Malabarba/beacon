#+TITLE: Beacon --- Never lose your cursor again

I forked and updated this as multiple functionalities of the package were not
working out of the box. I fixed issues on for running on M1 macs where the
cursor wouldn't blink for vertical movements or window changes. This repository
is not in ELPA or MELPA and would require installing this locally.

This is a global minor-mode.  Turn it on everywhere with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(beacon-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

[[file:example-beacon.gif]]

Whenever the window scrolls a light will shine on top of your cursor
so you know where it is.

That’s it.

** Customizations

- The appearance of the beacon is configured by ~beacon-size~ and
  ~beacon-color~.

- The duration is configured by ~beacon-blink-duration~ and
  ~beacon-blink-delay~.

- To customize /when/ the beacon should blink at all, configure
  ~beacon-blink-when-window-scrolls~,
  ~beacon-blink-when-window-changes~, and
  ~beacon-blink-when-point-moves~.

- To prevent the beacon from blinking only on specific situations
  configure ~beacon-dont-blink-major-modes~,
  ~beacon-dont-blink-predicates~, or ~beacon-dont-blink-commands~. You
  can also disable it only in specific buffers by doing
  ~(setq-local beacon-mode nil)~.

- Beacon can also push the mark for you whenever point moves a long
  distance. For this, configure ~beacon-push-mark~.
